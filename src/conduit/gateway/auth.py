"""Static API key -> team, quota, policy.

The shape is `mcp-gateway`'s: a key is a row in a config table, checked on every
request, with no token exchange and no directory to reach. Two differences, both
forced by what Conduit does with the answer:

- The row resolves to a `Principal` rather than to the key string, because the
  pipeline needs the team (telemetry attribution), the quota (rate limit and
  daily budget) and the policy (tier ceiling) — not just "yes".
- `Authorization: Bearer <key>` is accepted alongside `X-API-Key`, because the
  OpenAI SDK sends the former and AC-1 says an unmodified SDK client works.

Resolution does no I/O and is the first thing that happens to a request, so a
bad key costs a dict lookup and nothing else (AC-3).

"""The request pipeline: auth, guards, router, providers, guards, telemetry.

The order is fixed by the epic and enforced here rather than merely documented.
`StageLog.enter` refuses a stage that does not come strictly after the last one,
so moving the router call above the ingress guard raises `PipelineOrderError`
instead of quietly shipping an unguarded prompt to a vendor (AC-5).

Four seams are worth reading before changing anything in this module, because
each is a place two independently-built packages disagree until the gateway
makes a choice:

**One telemetry row per request.** `recorder.record(req)` wraps the *entire*
request — every failover hop, the guards on both ends, the router. Wrapping the
provider call instead would emit one row per hop and silently break #7's "exactly
one row per request" invariant.

**Redaction is per-request, not per-message.** `GuardChain` inspects one string
and `redact()` restarts its `<PERSON_n>` counters on every call, so inspecting
each message separately would mint two different `<PERSON_1>`s and merge them
into one entity map — rehydrating the wrong name into the caller's answer. The
chain therefore sees the whole prompt joined, and the resulting map is applied
back to each message by substituting originals for placeholders.

**The egress guard observes; it does not redact.** Re-scanning the completion is
worth doing, but applying that scan's `redacted_text` would hand the caller
fresh placeholders that the ingress entity map cannot resolve — the exact thing
AC-8's round trip forbids. So egress uses the verdict for risk and categories,
then rehydrates from the ingress map.

**Spend is priced from the registry.** `response.usage.cost_usd` is the
adapter's own figure; the ledger is fed `RoutingPolicy.price()` instead, which
reads `config/models.yaml`. The recorder reprices identically. Adding a third
path here is how the cost column and `/metrics` start to disagree.
